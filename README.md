Java Class Generator for XBMC's JSON-RPC
========================================

Since introspect gives all the information needed, this is an approach to
compile types and methods automatically into Java classes that can be used to
access the API.

Notes
-----

This is my second try, this time in Java. Used library is Jackson for the JSON
parsing.

Status
------

Work in progress.

Usage
